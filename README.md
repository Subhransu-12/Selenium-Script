Selenium is an open-source framework for automating web applications.
It provides a suite of tools to interact with browsers,
enabling the automation of repetitive tasks like form filling and testing.
Selenium scripts use programming languages like Python or Java to control browsers
and simulate user interactions for efficient web testing and automation.
